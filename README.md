Scripts for getting a list of active laws in the Republic of Lithuania.

Requirements:

    PHP with SimpleXML and Tidy extensions.

Usage:

Currently it just fetches pages from the Parliament document database, parses them and gets an array of links to laws, bills and decisions.

The parsed information is not stored anywhere.
